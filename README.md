# Hi, I’m Quan (Galvin) 👋  
**18 | Hanoi, Vietnam | Data • Math • Curiosity-driven builder**

I’m a freshman who enjoys turning **numbers into stories**, **data into decisions**, and **curiosity into projects**.  
Currently on a long-term journey toward **Data Science / Business Analytics**, with a strong foundation in **math, logic, and structured thinking**.

This GitHub is not a highlight reel — it’s a **learning log**.

## 🧠 What I’m about

- 📊 **Data & Analytics**  
  I care about *why* numbers behave the way they do, not just how to compute them.  
  Interests: data analysis, causal inference, applied statistics, and data-driven decision-making.

- 🧮 **Mathematics-first mindset**  
  Multiple medals in math competitions shaped how I think: precise, skeptical, and proof-oriented.

- 🌱 **Long-term growth**  
  I focus on fundamentals, clean reasoning, and real understanding.

- 🎯 **Big-picture goals**  
  Internship in big company, meaningful work, and building things that actually matter.

## 🔧 What you’ll find here

- **Data analysis projects**  
  From exploratory analysis to structured insights (Python, pandas, visualization).

- **Statistics & probability notebooks**  
  Bayesian thinking, hypothesis testing, intuition-first explanations.

- **Algorithms & problem-solving**  
  Clean implementations, templates, and thought processes (not just accepted solutions).

- **Experiments & learning notes**  
  Some repos are messy by design — learning isn’t linear.

## 🛠 Tech I’m working with

- **Languages:** Python, SQL (learning) 
- **Data:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib  
- **Foundations:** statistics, probability, linear algebra  
- **Tools:** Git, Jupyter Notebook

*(This list will evolve — I'm trying 😎.)*

---

## 📈 Current focus

- Building **portfolio-level data projects**
- Strengthening **statistical reasoning**
- Learning how to **ask better questions**

---

## 🧭 A note for recruiters / mentors

I’m early in the journey — and intentional about it.  
If you value **clarity of thinking, discipline, and long-term potential**, we’ll get along.
